Hi there! I'm a web developer currently based on Lima, Per√∫.

I'm currently working in [Silverback Ventures](https://silverback.ventures) as the web developer for our product, before I worked at [Able](https://able.co), [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and [Platzi](https://platzi.com).

I have also taught Web Development at Platzi and [Codeable](https://codeable.la), a full-stack development bootcamp created by Able to teach our development stack, React and Rails. At Codeable I created the initial curriculum for Frontend.
